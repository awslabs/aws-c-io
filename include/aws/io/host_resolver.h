/**
 * Creates a host resolver with the default behavior. Here's the behavior:
 *
 * Since there's not a reliable way to do non-blocking DNS without a ton of risky work that would need years of testing
 * on every Unix system in existence, we work around it by doing a threaded implementation.
 *
 * When you request an address, it checks the cache. If the entry isn't in the cache it creates a new one.
 * Each entry has a potentially short lived back-ground thread based on ttl for the records. Once we've populated the
 * cache and you keep the resolver active, the resolution callback will be invoked immediately. When it's idle, it will
 * take a little while in the background thread to fetch more, evaluate TTLs etc... In that case your callback will be
 * invoked from the background thread.
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * A few things to note about TTLs and connection failures.
 *
 * We attempt to honor your max ttl but will not honor it if dns queries are failing or all of your connections are
 * marked as failed. Once we are able to query dns again, we will re-evaluate the TTLs.
 *
 * Upon notification connection failures, we move them to a separate list. Eventually we retry them when it's likely
 * that the endpoint is healthy again or we don't really have another choice, but we try to keep them out of your
 * hot path.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Finally, this entire design attempts to prevent problems where developers have to choose between large TTLs and thus
 * sticky hosts or short TTLs and good fleet utilization but now higher latencies. In this design, we resolve every
 * second in the background (only while you're actually using the record), but we do not expire the earlier resolved
 * addresses until max ttl has passed.
 *
 * This for example, should enable you to hit thousands of hosts in the Amazon S3 fleet instead of just one or two.
