--- README FOR unittests.* files ---

These files are used in unit tests that create TLS connections between a
localhost server and client. We use a single self-signed certificate which
serves as both the server's certificate and the client's root CA.

unittests.key: private key, pkcs#1 syntax
unittests.crt: self-signed certificate
unittests.conf: configuration for generating unittests.crt
unittests.p8: private key, pkcs#8 syntax
unittests.p12: pkcs#12 file bundling the certificate and private key. Password is "1234"

Apple won't trust any certificate whose lifetime is over 825 days.
Once it expires unit tests will start failing and it will need to be updated like so:

$ openssl req -x509 -new -key unittests.key -config unittests.conf -out unittests.crt -days 824
$ openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -out unittests.p8 -in unittests.key -nocrypt
$ openssl pkcs12 -export -out unittests.p12 -inkey unittests.key -in unittests.crt -password pass:1234
